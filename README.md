Mass fish mortality events in Michigan inland lakes

This repository contains the data and code that supports the manuscript: Alofs KM and KE Wehrly. In Prep. Fish Mass Mortality Events in Northern Temperate Lakes Are Occurring Later in the Year than they Did Historically.

The manuscript tests for changes in the timing of reported fishkills in the state of Michigan between 1936 and 2022. Data were compiled from three sources: a) reports collected through a collaborative effort to digitize Michigan’s historical lake survey records. Historical records were transcribed by more than 2500 volunteers through the online citizen science platform Zooniverse. Within the ‘Angling for Data on Michigan Fishes’ Zooniverse project (https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/jmschell/angling-for-data-on-michigan-fishes) we captured data from ‘fish mortality’ cards, b) fish mortality events submitted as notes by MDNR staff after 2007, c) reports sent by the public through the MDNR ‘eyes in the field’ app starting in 2018. 

The 'Code' folder includes the script used for data visualization and analysis in R: mortality_timing.R

The 'Data' folder includes the dataset used for analysis: mortality_timing.csv and associated metadata.
